# ArcGIS Python Toolbox

## Overview

This project maintains robust partnerships with existing and upcoming commercial data providers, and regularly ingests and processes a variety of SAR and non-SAR (i.e. optical, infrared, multi-spectral, and hyperspectral) data. This collection of data partners is referred to as Ursaâ€™s Virtual Constellation.

This Space performs this processing through the development and deployment of the Platform. The platform contains the data and software services required to ingest data, run analytics and algorithms on these data to produce results, and provide customer access to related data feeds via API.

## Project Description
